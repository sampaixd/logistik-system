Logistik system

Overview

This is an API projekt from school, demonstrating the implementation of a logistics system using express as well as mongoDB and mongoose

Files and their purpose:

controllers - The processes working with the database
error - custom made errors
routes - communication between server and client
schema - database schemas
src - connects all routes, opens connection to localhost and database

The files are named after the different components and mostly work only with that component, however there are instances where for example storage works with shipments.
